- data set downloaded from this repo

## How to reproduce the result
- install R studio
- download the data set and R file
- set seed at 242,run the code

 

## Motivation:
Predicting housing price has always been a hot topic in data analytics field. During our undergraduate studies, we have witnessed a great change in housing prices in California. For instance, in San Diego where we spent 4 years studying, the housing prices have increased 50% from 2015 to 2019. Thus, we are pretty curious about if we can apply Machine Learning techniques on correctly forecasting sales price of houses. On the other hand, since many real estate businesses rely on deciding the appropriate prices to sell their houses, we believe our project can potentially help them in this regard. Moreover, investors who are interested in real estates and individual householder who wants to buy/sell house can benefit from our results as well.


## Conclusion: 
The best model for our dataset is 
```
forward stepwise regression
